# Hi there, I'm Zak! 👋

I got my first taste of programming through my undergraduate studies at USC, and I've been hooked ever since. Building software products that I find interesting and potentially useful. Currently developing an ChatGPT-based plugin for Obsidian (see [here](https://github.com/zakhij/obsidian-highlightaskgpt)).
