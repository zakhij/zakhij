### Hi there, I'm Zak! 👋

## I got my first taste of programming through my undergraduate studies at USC, and I've been hooked ever since. I build software projects that interest me. Currently developing an Obsidian plugin that tacks ChatGPT onto the right-click context menu (see [here](https://github.com/zakhij/obsidian-highlightaskgpt)).
