# Hi there, I'm Zak! 👋

I got my first taste of programming through my undergraduate studies at USC, and I've been hooked ever since. I build software projects that interest me. Currently developing an ChatGPT-based plugin for Obsidian (see [here](https://github.com/zakhij/obsidian-highlightaskgpt)). 

### Some of my other interests...
- 🧠 **Learning**: Always on the hunt for new knowledge and skills, whether it's tech-related or something else.
- 🏀 **Basketball**: I'm a huge NBA fan. Go Kings!
- 📚 **Reading**: Give me your best book rec, fiction or non-fiction.
